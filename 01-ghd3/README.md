Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
===
I have created an animation of pong. The ball is a circle, the paddles are rectangles, there are lines in the center that follow the ball, and there are goal posts that are made out of polgons (triangles)

Technical Achievement: 
    I have animated pong. The paddles move autonomously and the ball bounces off of the ceiling and paddles. 
    There is an extra detail that I added to the center of the game that fills up extra space. Asthetically I feel that this makes the game look more active. The lines in the center create an opening for the ball to move through.

Design Achievement: 
    A design decision I made wasa to change the way the paddles would move depending on which one hit it last. If the red paddle has hit it most recently, then the transition time for it to move and follow the ball is actually increased. This makes it look like both paddles are moving under different behavior.
    Another design feature was to randomize the starting position and angle of the ball.
